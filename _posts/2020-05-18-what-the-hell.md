I wrote one sports article in 2013 and it went straight to my head. a major outlet picked it up and published it it; a few other amateurs gnashed their teeth, I haven’t been published since. Presently. At the time of writing, anyway.

The reason I say a few *other* amateurs is because I too am an amateur. You should get comfortable with this reality. 

My name is M. David Thurman. 

I don’t exist. This blog does.
