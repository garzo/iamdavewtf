well it’s mostly an attempt by a has-been to chase clout for no reason other than sheer boredom and inflated sense of importance as to one’s own opinion. the writer doesn’t particularly like describing himself, it somehow feels more vain than starting a sports and culture blog in a time dominated by a weird and unspoken implication that twitter is somehow representative of anything.

said has-been was published once in 2013 and like a former debate team captain who peaked at regionals his senior year of high school, said has-been continues to cling to this accomplishment even though the article in question, not even the outlet where the article was published exist anymore.

the has-been learned a valuable lesson about file backups. as if he’d ever get anyone to hire him for the words he’d written. 

# You should know this much going in...

This wont be a particularly well written blog. There isn’t an editorial board, or a room full of proofreaders or a cadre of social media interns waiting to ‘dunk’ on anybody who didn’t read past the headline. It’s just you, the reader, and a has-been who lives alone in Chicago with his cat.

Sorry about that.

 If that admission gives future writers ammunition to take me down for some future inscrutable collection of words that results in mass-kvetching on twitter, this will be considered thoroughly and later dismissed with extreme prejudice.
